-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pure, virtuous, unadulterated programming bliss - hastily assembled C programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The C-Haste Library (libchaste)
===============================

License:
--------
See LICENSE file included. TL;DR - BSD 3 Clause. 


Main features:
--------------
Data structures: generic, type safe array, vector and linked list (hash map partially implemented)

Type safe command line options parser with super simple syntax, usage text etc. 

Powerful logging with runtime and compile time log level tuning, coloured output. 


Todo/In progress
-----------------
Architecture agnositc performance monitoring and measuring tools around RDTSC/PMC/PDU 

Yet another string library to efficiently do useful string manipulations using nice macros to make 


Currently builds on:
---------------------
    - x86 Linux (Ubtuntu 12.10/13.04) (clang 3.2 and gcc 4.6-4.8)
    - x86 Darwin (Mac OSX 10.10/10.11) (clang 7.0)

Targeted to build on: 
    - Linux/BSD/Darwin (OS X)
    - 32bit/64bit (64bit optimized)
    - ARM / x86


Obtaining the source: 
----------------------

The C-Haste library is available at https://github.com/mgrosvenor/libchaste 

- The master branch is a "stable" "release" candidate -- the bleeding edge - guaranteed compile and pass unit tests -- API may vary wildly. 
- Release branches are stable, tagged with the release ID. Incremental fixes to a release will be tags added to the release branch. Bug fixes only. No new features. No new APIs. 


Building
---------

Libchaste builds on both gcc 4.6 and clang 3.2 against the c11 standard with pedantic warnings and errors using the Posix 2008 system API. 

It includes a set of unit tests and infrastructure for making them all running and passing valgrind tests. 

- run build.sh to build a debug libcahste.a binary in the bin/ directory. 
- run build_release.sh to build a release binary libcahste.tar.bz 

Requirements
-------------
Cake build system - https://github.com/Zomojo/Cake
Clang 3.2+ / GCC 4.6+
