/**
 * \brief Exasock socket option for disabling acceleration on the socket
 *
 * Disabling of acceleration on a socket is not allowed if the socket has
 * already been accelerated (either by binding it to an ExaNIC interface
 * or joining a multicast group with an ExaNIC interface). Once acceleration
 * has been disabled on the socket, it can no longer be re-enabled. If any of
 * above rules is not followed setsocketopt() fails with EPERM error.
 *
 * Using a zero value for this socket option will enable acceleration
 * when global acceleration is disabled. Note that even in this case,
 * manually disabling acceleration on the socket is permanent (as above).
 *
 * This is Exasock private socket level option (the level argument of
 * setsockopt()/getsockopt() needs to be specified as SOL_EXASOCK).
 * This option takes an int value. This is a Boolean option.

/**
 * \brief Exasock socket option for passively listening to multicast data
 * arriving on an ExaNIC interface
 *
 * Setting SO_EXA_MCAST_LISTEN has a similar effect to setting the
 * IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP socket option with an ExaNIC interface specified in
 * imr_address or imr_ifindex.  However the SO_EXA_MCAST_LISTEN option does not
 * result in multicast joins being sent.  Also, with SO_EXA_MCAST_LISTEN, it is
 * possible to allow receiving the multicast group's data from any local ExaNIC
 * interface (if imr_address is set to INADDR_ANY and imr_ifindex is set to 0).
 * If such a wildcard is specified to IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, the kernel will
 * arbitrarily choose one interface and kernel bypass acceleration will be lost.
 *
 * This option should not be used together with IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP on the same
 * socket, but rather as an alternative, if needed.  If IGMP joins are still
 * required, additional steps need to be taken to make sure the multicast group
 * has been joined, for example joining the group in another process.
 *
 * Due to the design of exasock, an application should not configure more than
 * one accelerated socket receiving the same multicast group from the same
 * interface.  (Only one socket will receive the data.)
 *
 * SO_EXA_MCAST_LISTEN is not allowed if acceleration has already been disabled
 * on the socket.  (setsockopt() will fail with EPERM.)
 *
 * This is Exasock private socket level option (the level argument of
 * setsockopt() needs to be specified as SOL_EXASOCK).
 *
 * The argument is ip_mreqn structure (or alternatively ip_mreq structure), just
 * like in the case of IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP socket option:
 * - imr_multiaddr: Contains the address of the multicast group. It must be a
 *                  valid multicast address (or setsockopt() fails with the
 *                  error EINVAL).
 * - imr_address:   The address of the local ExaNIC interface from which the
 *                  socket wants to receive the multicast data; if it is equal
 *                  to INADDR_ANY, the socket will receive the multicast data
 *                  arriving through any of local ExaNIC interfaces.
 * - imr_ifindex:   The interface index of the ExaNIC interface to receive data
 *                  from, or 0 to indicate any ExaNIC interface.
