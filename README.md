# P4DNS

P4DNS is an implementation of an in-network DNS server.

P4DNS is intended to explore the scope and limitations of implementing standard services within programmable network devices. 

P4DNS is implemented using the P4-NetFPGA workflow on NetFPGA SUME, using SDNet 2018.2 and Vivado 2018.2.

This project was developed as part the University of Cambridge [P51 course, 2019](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/P51/)
